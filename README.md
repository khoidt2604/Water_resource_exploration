# 💧 Water Resource Exploration in Arid and Urban Regions

This repository contains Tableau visualisations and a project report from a data exploration study on sustainable water resource usage across **California**, **Utah**, and **New York City**. The focus is on understanding regional water efficiency and sustainability through visual storytelling.

---

## 📌 Introduction

This project explores how regions with different environmental conditions manage water sustainability. We use interactive dashboards to analyse:

- Agricultural irrigation practices in **Utah**
- Water supplier efficiency metrics in **California**
- Urban building sustainability in **New York City**

Each dashboard highlights specific water-use challenges and visual insights that can help drive informed decision-making.

---

## 🌱 Motivation

Water is a vital but limited resource. In both arid agricultural zones and dense urban settings, sustainability practices vary widely. By visualising real-world data:

- Stakeholders can compare regional performance
- Policymakers can identify effective conservation strategies
- The public gains transparency into local water usage

## 📊 Key Visualisations

| Region        | Dashboard File         | Focus Area                                       |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Utah**      | `Landuse.twb`          | Irrigated acreage by **basin** and **method**   |
| **California**| `Fiscalyear.twb`       | Supplier metrics: **Evapotranspiration (Eto)** and **Effective Precipitation** |
| **NYC**       | `NYC_buiding_law.twb`  | ENERGY STAR Scores by **building type** and **borough** |

All dashboards are built in Tableau and allow users to filter by attributes, explore spatial patterns, and view sustainability metrics.
